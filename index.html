            In February 2013, I started designing a peripheral for my TI-84 graphing calculator that would allow it to run theater lights over the DMX protocol. The idea is that the calculator sends changes in channel values to an Arduino, which processes the new channel value(s) while also transmitting DMX packets 44 times per second. The adapter is designed to be compatible with all calculators that can send data over the standard TI link port, which encompasses nearly all TI graphing calculators. I demonstrated the project at Engineering Open House 2014 using motorized DJ lights.
          </p>
          <p>
             The project is available on <a href="https://www.github.com/ajcord/DATA-Project" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://hackaday.io/project/2170-DMX-84%3A-Calculator-Controlled-Lights" target="_blank">Hackaday Projects</a>.

            In August 2011, I began work on an extension for Google Chrome to add a home screen of apps to the new tab page. In the summer of 2012, I finally published version 1.0 of Launchpage. I later published version 1.1, adding the ability to save any website to the home screen, and I'm working now on version 1.2, which will add several new features.

            From March 2011 to March 2012, I designed and led others in building a portable training device as my Eagle Scout project for the Versailles Fire Department. Part of my project was documenting the setup and usage of the training wall through videos, available on YouTube, which are embedded below.

            At the beginning of my junior year of high school, I began to create an online sensory game for autistic children. It is a puzzle game designed for tablets such as the iPad. The game allows the child to manipulate color-tagd trains to match them to the corresponding tracks. When the trains are all in the correct positions, a reward animation plays. The purpose of the game is to improve fine motor skills while simultaneously entertaining and calming the child.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, because the HTML5 game is still a work-in-progress, I can't provide a link. However, once it is completed, it will be hosted on a website that tablet users can add to their home screens and run as if it was a normal app.

          <p>I built, set up, and maintain an online store for a local client who sells Porsche parts. It is hosted at <a href="http://www.plyhammersparts.biz" target="_blank">plyhammersparts.biz</a>. I also set up and manage social media profiles such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/plyhammer" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/plyhammer" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://youtube.com/plyhammersparts" target="_blank">YouTube</a> for the company.</p>
          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>In February 2011, my former teacher and cross country coach, Mark Pleiman, asked me if I knew how to make a website. He told me he was starting a business to buy old Porsches and sell the parts, and he wanted to sell the parts on a more professional website than eBay. He gave me his business card and told me that he would pay me if I could build a website for him. I had been coding in HTML for years, but I had never created a website before.</p>
          <p>I searched around to find the various options for shopping cart software, and the one I chose to use was <a href="http://www.zen-cart.com/" target="_blank">Zen Cart</a>. I then downloaded a copy of Zen Cart and went to work modifying it to suit my client's needs. I changed the stylesheets to match the style of the business card, but I also needed to modify some of the PHP code to make the website work as my client wanted it to work. However, since I didn't know any PHP, I researched about it until I had enough skills to tackle the website. I have since researched more about PHP, but I still have a lot to learn about it.</p>
          <p>Once the website was ready, I set up hosting and registered the domain for my client. He trusts me with all the information I need to set up automatic bill payment for the hosting and registration. After I set up the main website, I also set up a hosted WordPress blog as well as all of the social media accounts I listed above. Once everything was in place, I spent a day teaching him and his wife how to use the software to manage the online store. In 2012, the website averaged 11,390 requests per month.</p>

          <p>I set up and ran the electronic timing system at home track meets. Some of my duties included:</p>

            <li>Capturing each race on video on the computer</li>
            <li>Analyzing each race to determine the finish time of each runner</li>
            <li>Importing the timing data from each race into the meet manager software and resolving any issues or discrepancies with the timing results</li>
            <li>Typing the scores from each of the field events into the meet manager software</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The timing team used two programs to run each meet. We used <a href="http://www.eagleeyedv.com/" target="_blank">Eagle Eye</a> to record and analyze races and <a href="http://www.hy-tekltd.com/track-meet-management.html" target="_blank">Hy-Tek Meet Manager</a> to calculate the scoring, placing, results, seeding, etc. of the meet.</p>

          <p>I volunteered at my high school's theater to set up, program, and run the lighting system for several performances throughout the year. I also coordinated the lighting crew to make sure someone would be available to run the lights for each show. From September 2010 to February 2013, the light board that I used was a Bijou Plus 48/96. Although it was not a fancy piece of equipment, it got the job done until it started malfunctioning. In February 2013, the school installed a new software-based lighting system using a program called <a href="http://www.lifact.com/" target="_blank">Light Factory</a>. I was the first of the lighting crew to embrace the new system and to learn how to use it for the shows following the new installation. Using Light Factory, I was able to set up music-synchronized lights for a showchoir performance, which was a huge hit. This would never have been possible with the Bijou light board.</p>
          <h4>List of performances</h4>
          <p>These are some of the performances and performers for which I was the lighting designer/technician:</p>
          <ul>

            <li><a href="http://francdambrosio.com/" target="_blank">Franc D'Ambrosio</a>, the singer who played the Phantom in <span class="performance">The Phantom of the Opera</span> on Broadway</li>

            <li>Nationally-touring a capella group <a href="http://www.ballinthehouse.com/" target="_blank">Ball in the House</a></li>

            <li>Many performances by the Versailles High School showchoir called <i>Encore!</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>For some of these performances, I worked with famous performers and directors that I would never have been able to meet if I would not have been part of the technical crew at the theater. I also had the opportunity to work with lighting and sound professionals, and they taught me much more about lighting than I could have learned on my own.</p>

        <h2>Running theater lights from a calculator</h2>
        <p>
          I designed, built, and programmed an Arduino-based device that connects to both a TI graphing calculator as well as DMX-wired theater or DJ lights. The calculator sends channel values to the Arduino, which in turn sends valid DMX packets to the dimmer racks. I also wrote the necessary driver for a TI-83 or 84 to communicate with the Arduino. The project was featured on Hackaday.com on Aug. 3, 2014.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Launchpage</h2>
        <p>
          I created a Google Chrome extension (written in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript) that replaces the new tab page with a home screen of apps, like an iPad. Features include speed, custom backgrounds, a "chameleon" color scheme that adjusts to match the background image, and the ability to add arbitrary webpages.
