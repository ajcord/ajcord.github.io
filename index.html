          <p>I have worked on several web development projects ranging in size. Some of my projects include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Creating an HTML5 version of the old Flash color selectors, including making them work on iPads. Links: <a href="http://www.midmark.com/color-selectors/medical-color-selector/index.html" target="_blank">Medical</a>, <a href="http://www.midmark.com/color-selectors/dental-color-selector/index.html" target="_blank">Dental</a>, and <a href="http://www.midmark.com/color-selectors/animal-health-color-selector/004-0588.html" target="_blank">Animal Health</a></li>
            <li>Making an offline version of <a href="http://www.midmarkclinicalsolutions.com" target="_blank">midmarkclinicalsolutions.com</a> for the sales representatives' iPads and tablet PCs</li>
            <li>Creating HTML5 versions of three Flash banners at <a href="http://www.midmarkanimalhealth.com/total-solutions" target="_blank">midmarkanimalhealth.com</a></li>
            <li>Making various content edits to the corporate website, <a href="http://www.midmark.com" target="_blank">midmark.com</a></li>

        <div id="track-info" class="hidden">
          <p class="time">March 2011 to May 2013</p>
          <p>I set up and ran the electronic timing system at home track meets. Some of my duties included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Detecting the flash from the starter's gun using a flash sensor</li>
            <li>Capturing each race on video on the computer</li>
            <li>Analyzing each race to determine the finish time of each runner</li>
            <li>Importing the timing data from each race into the meet manager software and resolving any issues or discrepancies with the timing results</li>
            <li>Typing the scores from each of the field events into the meet manager software</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The timing team used two programs to run each meet. We used <a href="http://www.eagleeyedv.com/" target="_blank">Eagle Eye</a> to record and analyze races and <a href="http://www.hy-tekltd.com/track-meet-management.html"target="_blank">Hy-Tek Meet Manager</a> to calculate the scoring, placing, results, seeding, etc. of the meet.</p>

        <div id="plyhammer-info" class="hidden">
          <p class="time">February 2011 to present</p>
          <p>I built, set up, and maintain an online store for a local client who sells Porsche parts. It is hosted at <a href="http://www.plyhammersparts.biz" target="_blank">plyhammersparts.biz</a>. I also set up and manage social media profiles such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/plyhammer" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/plyhammer" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://youtube.com/plyhammersparts" target="_blank">YouTube</a> for the company.</p>
          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>In February 2011, my former teacher and cross country coach, Mark Pleiman, asked me if I knew how to make a website. I had been coding in HTML for years, but I had never created a website before. He told me he was starting a business to buy old Porsches and sell the parts, and he wanted to sell the parts on his own website rather than on eBay. He gave me his business card and told me that he would pay me if I could build a website for him.</p>
          <p>I searched around to find the various options for shopping cart software, and the one I chose to use was <a href="http://www.zen-cart.com/" target="_blank">Zen Cart</a>. I then downloaded a copy of Zen Cart and went to work modifying it to suit my client's needs. I changed the stylesheets to match the style of the business card, but I also needed to modify some of the PHP code to make the website work as my client wanted it to work. However, since I didn't know any PHP, I researched about it until I had enough skills to tackle the website. I have since researched more about PHP, but I still have a lot to learn about it.</p>
          <p>Once the website was ready, I set up hosting and registered the domain for my client. He trusts me with all the information I need to set up automatic bill payment for the hosting and registration. After I set up the main website, I also set up a hosted WordPress blog as well as all of the social media accounts I listed above. Once everything was in place, I spent a day teaching him and his wife how to use the software to manage the online store. In 2012, the website averaged 11,390 requests per month.</p>

        <div id="vpac-info" class="hidden">
          <p class="time">September 2010 to July 2013</p>
          <p>I volunteered at my school's theater to set up, program, and run the lighting system for several performances throughout the year. I also coordinated the lighting crew to make sure someone would be available to run the lights for each show. From September 2010 to February 2013, the light board that I used was a Bijou Plus 48/96. Although it was not a fancy piece of equipment, it got the job done. In February 2013, the school installed a new software-based lighting system using a program called <a href="http://www.lifact.com/" target="_blank">Light Factory</a>. I was the first of the lighting crew to embrace the new system and to learn how to use it for the shows following the new installation. Using Light Factory, I was able to set up music-synchronized lights for a showchoir performance, which was a huge hit. This would never have been possible with the Bijou light board.</p>
          <h4>List of performances</h4>
          <p>These are some of the performances for which I was the lighting designer/technician:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.centerforarts.net/" target="_blank">Darke County Center for the Arts</a>-sponsored performance of <span class="performance">Sleeping Beauty</span> by <a href="http://www.americanfamilytheater.com/" target="_blank">American Family Theater</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://towne-and-country-players.com/" target="_blank">Towne and Country Players</a>' production of <span class="performance">The Wedding Singer</span></li>
            <li>A performance by <a href="http://francdambrosio.com/" target="_blank">Franc D'Ambrosio</a>, the singer who played the Phantom in <span class="performance">The Phantom of the Opera</span> on Broadway</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.bandofflight.af.mil/" target="_blank">The United States Air Force Band of Flight</a></li>
            <li>Nationally-touring a capella group <a href="http://www.ballinthehouse.com/" target="_blank">Ball in the House</a></li>
            <li class="performance">Thoroughly Modern Millie</li>
            <li class="performance">Cap'n Hook</li>
            <li class="performance">Grease</li>
            <li class="performance">The Trials of Robin Hood</li>
            <li class="performance">The Sound of Music</li>
            <li class="performance">M*A*S*H</li>
            <li>Elvis tribute band <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Comeback-Special/147377142009429" target="_blank">Comeback Special</a></li>
            <li>Many performances by the Versailles High School showchoir called <i>Encore!</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>For some of these performances, I worked with famous performers and directors that I would never have been able to meet if I would not have been part of the technical crew at the theater. I also had the opportunity to work with lighting and sound professionals, and they taught me much more about lighting than I could have learned on my own.</p>
